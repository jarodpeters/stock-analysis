#stock-analysis

##Overview
This analysis was created for Steve to do some research on stocks to invest in for his parents.  He wants to view the past two years stocks to see what is best to invest in. We created buttons to simplify the macro process making it more efficient.
##Results
######Stock Performance
Most stocks saw a negative return for 2018 while they had profitable returns the previous years. This shows that RUN & ENPH are stocks that are increasing in value and could be profitable to Steve.
######Execution Times
The refactored code simplifies the computing process significantly, for my original code was about .03 seconds slower for both years.  This shows that simplifying the code can make things more efficient.

##Summary
Using refactored code gives you the advantage of simplifying the thought process for your system.  I personally see no disadvantage to using a simplified version of code as long as it still functions the same.
